## Projects in This Repository

### Easy to Alter Menu:

This project demonstrates a simplified, object-oriented system for managing restaurant menus, franchises, and businesses. The system allows for easy customization of menu items, pricing, and availability. Users can manage multiple restaurant franchises, calculate total bills for menu orders, and check available menus at specific times.

### Key Features:
- **Menu Management**: 
  - Create and manage menus with customizable items, prices, and availability times.
- **Bill Calculation**: 
  - Calculate the total bill for an order based on selected menu items.
- **Franchise Management**: 
  - Manage multiple franchises with different addresses and associated menus.
- **Time-Based Menu Display**: 
  - Check available menus based on specific time ranges.

This project serves as an excellent example of applying **object-oriented programming** principles in Python, with an emphasis on:
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Custom string representations (`__str__` method)

Feel free to modify or expand this project to suit your needs!

### Chocolate Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

This project uses web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup to collect and analyze data from a chocolate review website. It scrapes over 1700 reviews of chocolate bars, extracting information such as ratings, company names, and cocoa percentages. The project then visualizes the data with histograms and scatter plots, helping to answer questions like:

- Which chocolatiers make the highest-rated chocolate bars?
- Is there any correlation between the cocoa percentage and the chocolate rating?

Technologies used:
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
