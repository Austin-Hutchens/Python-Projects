### Easy to Alter Menu:

This project demonstrates a simplified, object-oriented system for managing restaurant menus, franchises, and businesses. The system allows for easy customization of menu items, pricing, and availability. Users can manage multiple restaurant franchises, calculate total bills for menu orders, and check available menus at specific times.

### Key Features:
- **Menu Management**: 
  - Create and manage menus with customizable items, prices, and availability times.
- **Bill Calculation**: 
  - Calculate the total bill for an order based on selected menu items.
- **Franchise Management**: 
  - Manage multiple franchises with different addresses and associated menus.
- **Time-Based Menu Display**: 
  - Check available menus based on specific time ranges.

This project serves as an excellent example of applying **object-oriented programming** principles in Python, with an emphasis on:
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Custom string representations (`__str__` method)
