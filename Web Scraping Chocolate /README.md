# Chocolate Scraping with BeautifulSoup

In this project, I used web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup to collect and analyze data from a chocolate review website that features over 1700 reviews of chocolate bars from around the world. 

The goal was to explore interesting questions such as:
- Which chocolatiers make the highest-rated chocolate bars?
- Is there any correlation between the cocoa percentage and the chocolate rating?

## Key Features:
- Scraped chocolate ratings, company names, and cocoa percentages from an HTML table using BeautifulSoup.
- Created a Pandas DataFrame to store and manipulate the scraped data.
- Generated a histogram to visualize the distribution of chocolate ratings.
- Used Matplotlib to create a scatter plot showing the relationship between cocoa percentage and rating.
- Applied NumPyâ€™s polyfit to calculate the line of best fit for the scatter plot.

This project showcases my ability to work with web scraping, data manipulation, and basic data visualization.

## Technologies Used:
